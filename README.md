Welcome to the School Grades Pandas project! This project involves the development of a bot designed to assist teachers in managing their students' grades efficiently.

Features
1) Student Grade Management: The bot initially comes preloaded with grades for 100 students in four subjects: Math, Physics, Sport, and Art.

2) Add New Data: With the bot, you can easily add new grades, students, and subjects to the dataset, making it a flexible tool for keeping track of your students' academic progress.

3) Average Grades: The bot can calculate and provide the average grade for each student and each subject, helping you gain insights into performance trends.

4) Performance Statistics: You can access various statistical analyses of student performance, including histograms, grade distribution by groups, and other useful statistics.

5) Top 5 Students: Utilizing Z-score calculations, the bot can determine and display the top 5 students across all subjects, making it easier to identify high-achieving individuals.
